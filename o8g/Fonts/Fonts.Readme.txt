Thanks for downloading this font!
You are free to use it wherever you want, but it would be nice to credit me.

Enjoy!

EDIT by Db0: Font is modified to have some semblance of lowercase character,  
             and also includes unicodes for the Android:Netrunner special characters which are used by the game. 
             See the included Unicode_reference.txt file.

### ANR_symbols_only-enlarged

This is an empty font, save for the special Android Netrunner symbols. (See Unicode_reference.txt file.). 
This means that the rest of the font is whatever you system default it.
