Legendary-Marvel-Deckbuilding-Game
==================================

An OCTGN3 game definition for the Legendary: Marvel Deckbuilding Game.

This project is currently a work-in-progress and as such, gameplay is a mixture of manual and automated moves and could be prone to bugs. The development code has been made available here to track its progress, but until the game is playable the commits will not follow any logical flow or patterns.

You are welcome to clone the repo and try the project out at any time. The data is uploaded in corresponding folders, you will have to compile the proper o8g and o8c format to install them in OCTGN. Documentation on how to use the game definition is NOT a priority at this time and will not be available during development.
